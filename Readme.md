This is my portfolio project that I am creating to showcase  what I am learning,  it contains a few of the set projects I have completed, also  my personal project that I have started  from scratch to put the knowledge of my learning into practice. I will be adding more games onto  the card table I am hoping to show each of the programing languages/styles that I have learnt within a diffrent game.

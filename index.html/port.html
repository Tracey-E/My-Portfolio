        <div class="Aboutme ">About myself</div>
        <h2>I live in Yorkshire, UK. <br>I started coding in June 2021. My ambition is to develop my own websites, as well as to develop my own game (I know my idea is unique as I have never found a game like the one I would like to create).
            <br>There is a part about coding I find frustrating, this is when I come across an error that I currently do not understand how to fix. (google is my best friend in these situations).
            <br>Within this portfolio I will be showing some of the projects that I have completed during my learning at Codecademy plus a project I am building on my own initiative in my free time.

            <h3>For my profile the reasons behind my ideas is I want to show my progress in web development and my understanding of HTML, CSS and Java Script. I am looking forward to continuing to learn and grow my knowledge base as I progress through the
                courses on CodeCademy. I have also learnt the basics in Java, Python and React. I know I still have more to learn, but when it comes to coding there is always something new to learn. I am also in the process of creating a website for my
                sister in my own time for her crafting projects. </h3>
